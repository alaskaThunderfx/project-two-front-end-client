const secondDoor = 'Above this door the number 3 is displayed on a label. You twist the doorknob to check if it is locked and are met with immediate resistance. It does not budge, it is locked... You see that there is a hole for a key in the knob...'
const thirdDoor = 'You immediately notice that, unlike the other two doors, this door has no numbered label above it. Another distinctly different feature this door possesses compared to the other two is... It is lacking a doorknob...'

The first one is of a cute and fluffy white dog, the second one is of a cute and fluffy white and grey guinea pig, the third is of a cute and fluffy black cat.
